## SFTP
SFTP is a secure and robust way to upload files to your website. In addition to uploading files, SFTP can be used for nearly all your file management needs for your website.

Before you follow the steps below, you'll need to have an SFTP client installed. [Filezilla](tutorials/upload_file/https://filezilla-project.org/ "Filezilla project and download site") is a popular Open Source client that works on Windows, Mac and Linux.

The following steps cover configuring a site in Filezilla and uploading a file through the app via SFTP.

1. Open Filezilla on your computer

1. Click *File > Site Manager*

1. Select _SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol_ from the _Protocol_ drop down listed

1. Populate the following fields:

   _Host:_ Enter your site's host name or IP address

   _Port:_ Enter _22_ unless you know the port is different than the default SSH port for your server

   _Logon Type:_ Select _Ask for password_ (so your password is not stored in clear text on the computer)

   _User:_ Enter the username for the Virtualmin user of the site you want to upload files for

## SSH/SCP
Sometimes you want to upload files via a command line interface. You can do this using SCP, which is the secure way to copy files over SSH.

### Windows
A popular SSH and SCP client on Windows is [Putty](tutorials/upload_file/http://www.putty.org/ "Putty Windows SSH and SCP client"). Download the _pscp.exe_ utility in order to transfer files securely via a Windows command.

Once you've downloaded _pscp.exe_, open a Windows command prompt and run the following from the same folder where the _pscp.exe_ file is to copy a test.html file from your Desktop folder to your host's _public_html_ directory:

```pscp -scp C:\Users\username\Desktop\test.html username@hostname:public_html/```

You may be prompted to accept an SSH key from the host. Enter _yes_ and then proceed to enter the password for the username you provided. The file progress will display and show 100% when completed.

```test.html                 | 0 kB |   0.4 kB/s | ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%```

### Mac and Linux
The _scp_ command is already available on Mac and Linux. Open a terminal window on run the following command to upload a _test.html_ file in your home directory to the host's _public_html_ directory:

```scp ~/test.html username@hostname:public_html/```

You may be prompted to accept an SSH key from the host. Enter _yes_ and then proceed to enter the password for the username you provided. The file progress will display and show 100% when completed.

```test.html                                     100%  399     8.8KB/s   00:00```Ã‚
